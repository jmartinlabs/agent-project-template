# Explicit approvals for protected operations

This policy applies to orchestrate, every delegated agent and every workflow.
It is an **instruction-level gate**, not an independently enforced security control.
A project may add stricter rules; those always win.

## Protected decisions

Each of these needs its own user approval:

- merging a PR;
- approving a Full specification or wireframes, or a substantive financial or product decision;
- authorizing development, when the project has a separate development gate;
- material security or architecture changes;
- destructive actions;
- production deployment or operational data migration;
- any other approval the project requires.

Green CI, finished QA, a pre-approved plan, earlier scope authorization or finished code
**never imply** approval of a different protected action.

## Ordinary work (no new approval)

Inside a scope the user already authorized, these need no per-step approval unless the
project says otherwise: implementation, tests, using subagents, branches, pushes, PR
preparation and local worktrees that meet the policy below. Treat them as continuing
authorized work, not as protected actions.

## How to ask and what counts

- Ask for **one identifiable decision** at a time. Name the target: PR number and HEAD SHA,
  spec ID and revision, environment, or changed scope. Several pending decisions need
  separate answers.
- An approval needs an **explicit approval verb**: `Approve PR #34 merge`,
  `I approve specification 07`, `Apruebo PR #34`, `Aprobada la especificación 07`.
- A bare `Approved` / `Aprobado` / `Apruebo` counts **only** when it answers exactly one
  clearly identified request made immediately before.
- `ok`, `okk`, `dale`, `continúa`, `continue`, `go ahead`, `adelante`, silence, reactions
  or any generic assent **never approve a protected action**. They may continue work that
  is already authorized.
- Never bundle a merge, spec acceptance, deployment or development authorization into one
  inferred approval.
- If the target, revision, intent or source is unclear, ask one short question and pause
  only the affected action. Independent permitted work may continue.

## Recording and reuse

- Record the exact scope, target, revision/SHA and the user's message in the resumable
  project record. A commit message or agent note saying "user approved" is **not evidence**.
- Reuse a specific valid approval; do not ask again for the same unchanged decision.
- Before acting, re-verify the target, current Git state, tests and project gates.
- A material change after approval (new SHA, new content, new artifact) needs fresh approval.

## GitHub PR merge example

1. Report: `PR #34 ready, HEAD abc123, checks green. To authorize merge reply: Apruebo PR #34`.
2. `Dale` does not permit the merge. `Apruebo PR #34` permits that **one PR** only.
3. Before merging, recheck HEAD and required checks. If content changed, ask again.

## Local worktrees

A local worktree needs **no individual approval** when all of these hold:

- it supports work already authorized by the user;
- it provides useful isolation;
- it does not affect existing work.

Before creating one, check the authorized scope, Git status (including uncommitted/untracked changes),
existing worktrees, branch and destination. Use a new, non-conflicting location;
never overwrite, move or discard existing changes. If you cannot verify this, keep the
current checkout or stop that step.

A Work Packet assigns responsibilities and file ownership; a worktree provides isolation;
authorization comes from the user's granted scope. Neither the packet nor the worktree grants
new tasks, protected actions, publication or merges. Preserve uncommitted changes and
never remove a worktree with pending work without user authorization.
Stricter derived-project restrictions always take precedence, including a rule that every
worktree needs approval.

Stronger enforcement (tool hooks, GitHub rulesets) needs separate configuration and an
authorization source agents cannot forge or edit.
