# Agent work packet (template)

> Copy into the coordinator's task context per delegate. This is NOT an agent-registration format or an instruction to create a worker when the environment cannot support it.

- **Packet ID:** TASK-UNSET
- **Epic / stream:** UNSET
- **Profile:** Functional | Implementation | QA | Infrastructure | bounded custom
- **Client / version / session ID:** OpenCode <verified version> or UNVERIFIED; runtime-controlled | external. Technical session ID only if known; otherwise a stable functional reference. Never invent an ID. Corrections keep the same packet ID and session.
- **Start/stop owner and permitted communication route:** UNSET; manual user relay without verified integration
- **Instruction entry points / capability check:** UNVERIFIED; confirm canonical rules are readable
- **Context:** fresh bounded context by default | inherited with concrete reason | unsupported/disclosed
- **Objective and done criteria:** UNSET
- **Source documents / links:** UNSET
- **Spec approval:** approved with source and date | draft (read-only/preparation only) | not applicable
- **Hard dependencies:** UNSET; note whether each is satisfied
- **Read files:** UNSET
- **Write files and sole ownership:** UNSET
- **Working branch / isolated checkout:** UNSET or read-only
- **Preflight / operation owners:** checkout/access, runtimes, dependencies, platform; owner of permission-sensitive steps
- **Shared test resources:** separate ports, databases and temporary directories | not applicable
- **Other active conflicting packets:** NONE / LIST
- **Permitted actions:** UNSET
- **Applicable rules:** UNSET — copy the 3–6 rules this task needs, one line each with its source link (for example approval gates touched, worktree/isolation, security or financial constraints, project-specific restrictions). The delegate reads this list instead of the full policies.
- **Prohibited actions:** approvals, merge, production deployment, destructive operations unless separately authorized
- **Verification commands / expected evidence:** UNSET
- **Verification environment / candidate:** local versus CI platform; SHA plus pending changes; full gate and focal delta checks
- **Evidence destination:** reachable commit/diff or existing progress/testplan section; no duplicate board
- **Blocking notice:** notify operation, reason and owner before a potentially suspending escalation; preserve native approval
- **Review milestones:** candidate | blocker | decision | final delta; no reminders without new information
- **User decisions to request:** NONE / LIST
- **Model selection:** requested model/effort; runtime assurance; observed model/effort and evidence or unverified; follow [model policy](../specs/methodology/model-selection.md)
- **Quota gate:** source/time, five-hour and weekly remaining or unavailable; restrictive value; task-specific authorization and warning if required
- **Return schema:** the copyable `HANDOFF → CODEX` block below, required in every interaction, including blocks and decisions; status COMPLETED / PARTIAL / BLOCKED / CANCELLED; tests PASS / FAIL / UNRUN with evidence; state in [coordinator communication](../specs/methodology/coordinator-communication.md)
- **Usage evidence:** client source and coverage | unavailable; never infer consumption or control of external workers

Coordinator updates `specs/epic-board.md` only after verifying the returned evidence and current canonical documents.

## Copyable manual OpenCode prompt
Fill every relevant placeholder before the user copies this block. Include the applicable
rules themselves; local source links alone are insufficient if the worker cannot read them.
Use the packet above as the single source of scope and authorization, not a second board.
Write the copyable text in the user's language, keeping the headings and field names.
When the coordinator is Claude Code, replace `CODEX` in the heading and return fields with `CLAUDE CODE`.

```text
Task ID and name: <packet ID> — <functional name>
Session reference: <technical session ID if known; otherwise the stable functional reference>
Client: OpenCode <verified version>; external, manually started/stopped by the user.
Repository, branch or worktree, base SHA, PR: <repo path, branch, base SHA, separate checkout; PR: none unless authorized>
Recommended model: <verified available model and rationale for bounded work> | UNVERIFIED: catalog not checked; request it before assigning a model.
Objective and minimum context: <task, relevant decisions, source paths and instruction entry points>.
Authorized scope: <approval source/date, allowed actions, editable paths and exclusions>.
Ownership and restrictions: <files this task owns, files it must not touch, other active tasks>.
Applicable rules: <copy the task's required rules and source links; preserve approvals>.
Deliverable and acceptance: <concrete checks and expected behavior>.
Tests: <commands, environment, expected evidence; report PASS/FAIL/UNRUN with evidence>.
Blockers: stop and report on missing permissions, conflicting requirements, ownership collisions or scope expansion. Do not work around them.
Implement, test, commit or prepare a PR only when covered by the stated authorization.
Never merge, deploy, self-approve QA, expand scope or start other workers.
Return exactly one final copyable message, also when blocked, partial or needing a decision, with this heading and every field:
HANDOFF → CODEX
Task ID and origin session: ...
Final status (COMPLETED / PARTIAL / BLOCKED / CANCELLED): ...
Summary and changes: ...
Relevant files and pending changes: ...
Branch, commit SHA, PR (or absent / unknown): ...
Tests (PASS / FAIL / UNRUN for each command, with command, environment, candidate: SHA plus pending changes, and evidence): ...
Risks, blockers and open problems: ...
Decisions needed (or NONE): ...
Recommended next action: ...
END HANDOFF → CODEX
```
